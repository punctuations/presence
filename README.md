#### A simple and elegant solution to images for social media!

---

Presence is a service that generates SVG images for social medias. It does this by accessing the endpoint, `presence.im/api/:platform/:type/:param`, where the API will return the image via headers. If you wish for base64 encoding, then append the `?type=base64` query to the end of the URL to obtain the base64 encoding of the image like so:

`GET https://presence.im/api/twitter/user/atmattt?type=base64`

```json
{ "data": "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZwogICAgICB4bWxucz0iaHR..." }
```

Presence also comes with themes! By adding the following queries to the endpoint you can change what some things look like!
